        <p>SCM solicitors were formed in January 2015 with the merger of Bridgend firms <strong>David Sedgwick Solicitors</strong>
          and <strong>Chudleigh Solicitors</strong>. The merger brought together 2 specialist criminal practices to become
          one of South Wales leading criminal law firms. We are a specialist criminal practice which services clients across
          the length of South Wales. Our experienced team of solicitors offer our clients a tailored service to meet their
